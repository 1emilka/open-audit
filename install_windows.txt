OAv2 installation using "source".
---------------------------------
Substitue the correct variable contents when items below are in CAPITALS.

1 - Download the package and extract the "www" directory to c:\xampp\htdocs
	zipfile\OAv2\www -> c:\xampp\htdocs

2 - Extract the files in the "OAv2" directory into xampp
	zipfile\OAv2 -> c:\xampp\OAv2

3 - Check the file c:\xampp\htdocs\index.php for the $system_folder variable.
	Ensure it is set as below.
	$system_folder = "c:/xampp/OAv2/code_igniter/system";

4 - Go to the \other folder (C:\xampp\OAv2\other) and edit the file audit_windows.vbs
	Make sure the variable "url" points to YOURSERVER.

5 - Copy the file c:\xampp\OAv2\other\OAv2_mysql.sql to c:\xampp\mysql\bin

6 - Create the database in Mysql
	cd into the c:\xampp\mysql\bin folder.
	Run the following: mysql -u root -pYOURPASSWORD 
	then run: create database OAv2;
	then run: exit;

7 - Back at the dos prompt, run
	c:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql -u root -pYOURPASSWORD OAv2 < OAv2_mysql.sql

8 - Lastly, check the file c:\xampp\OAv2\code_igniter\system\application\config\database.php
	Make sure the credentials are correct to access the database you just created.

9 - Finally, point your browser at http://YOURSERVER/ and you should be asked to log in. 
	Username: admin
	Password: password

If you can do that - then it is installed, congratulations.




Auditing Windows Systems
------------------------

Next, get a dos prompt and go to c:\xampp\OAv2\other and run: cscript audit_windows.vbs .

It should run and post the result to the database. Go back to your web browser and refresh. You should have a group or two created. Go into one of them and click the machine name. You should see the machine details.

To audit your domain, edit the file: c:\xampp\OAv2\other\audit_domain.vbs
Depending on your system's power, you may wish to ajust the "number_of_audits". I usually use 20. Make sure the "script_name" points to the correct place - 
script_name = "c:\xampp\OAv2\other\audit_windows.vbs"
Make sure the "local_domain" is correct. Try setting "operating_system" to "Windows" (I think people have had issue's leaving it blank). Run the script with: cscript audit_domain.vbs

You should see your domain PCs start to get audited by seperate audit_windows scripts.

Enjoy !!!
